# Laroussi Student Management system Project 2024
Laroussi Student Management System is a desktop application developed on Piside6 & Qt Designer.
is designed to record, analyze, and manage information in a school. These systems are updated by teachers and school administrators on a rolling basis to better serve the needs of the greater student body. Without them, schools would become disorganized, staff would lack clarity into scheduling and student activity, and it would become increasingly difficult for school districts to leverage data in the decision-making process.
